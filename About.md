Welcome to My Meccano Hobby — a space dedicated to preserving, celebrating, and sharing one of the most iconic construction systems ever created.

My name is Kevin Clark, and I live in the small northern village of Chetwynd, BC, surrounded by mountains, forests, and the kind of quiet that inspires creativity. For as long as I can remember, Meccano has been more than a pastime for me — it’s been a lifelong fascination with engineering, history, and the joy of building something with your own hands.

🛠️ A Collection Built Over a Lifetime
My collection spans the full breadth of Meccano’s golden years, from 1907 to 1979. Over time, I’ve gathered:

Original Meccano items and outfits

Catalogues, manuals, and rare ephemera

Historically significant pieces that showcase the evolution of Meccano through the decades

Models I’ve built myself, from classic designs to personal creations inspired by the system’s limitless possibilities

Every item tells a story — of the era it came from, the people who used it, and the imagination it sparked.

📚 Preserving Meccano History
Part of my passion lies in documenting and sharing the heritage of Meccano. Many of the catalogues, manuals, and paper materials in my collection are fragile pieces of history. By showcasing them here, I hope to help others appreciate the craftsmanship, design, and innovation that made Meccano a worldwide phenomenon.

🔧 Why I Built This Website
This site is my way of giving back to the community of builders, collectors, and enthusiasts who keep Meccano alive. Whether you’re here to explore vintage outfits, browse rare documentation, or simply enjoy the models, I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity.

Thank you for visiting, and for sharing in the joy of Meccano. If you’re a fellow collector or builder, I’d love to connect — after all, Meccano has always been about building things together.
